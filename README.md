# my assorted utility scripts

### addrcoords
Take an address, get the GPS Coordinates from Google

```
$ addrcoords '123 Main St, Springfield, ST 01023'
{
  "lat": 64.121415,
  "lng": -101.125193
}
```

### anagrams
Generate all anagrams of a string:

```
$ anagrams doe
doe
deo
ode
oed
edo
eod
```

Really interesting uses of this script would be to combine it with a dictionary of words and only select those anagrams that are words.

For example, Mac OS X has a dictionary `/usr/share/dict/words`

So we could filter out only those anagrams that are in the dictionary like so:

```
$ anagrams doe | for perm in $(cat -); do grep -i "^$perm$" /usr/share/dict/words; done
doe
ode
Edo
```

### argraph
ActiveRecord graph: makes a GraphViz digraph that shows all the `belongs_to` associations in a rails app

##### Usage:

Suppose you have the [discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse) rails app checked out, and you want to find out how some of it's models are interrelated:

```
$ cd discourse
$ argraph Post Topic Category PostReply User UserAction UserHistory QuotedPost View UserAvatar
digraph {
 Post -> User
 Post -> Topic
 Topic -> Category
 Topic -> User
 Category -> Topic
 Category -> User
 PostReply -> Post
 UserAction -> User
 QuotedPost -> Post
 QuotedPost -> QuotedPost
 View -> User
 UserAvatar -> User
}
$ !! | dot -Tpng > discourse.png
```

The output of `argraph` is a digraph in the [DOT language](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html), which can be rendered as an image using [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/).

*The nodes are ActiveRecord models, and the edges represent the 'belongs to' relation.*

The above graph renders as:

### battery

### db

### dumbplot

### exifyear
Extract year from DateTimeOriginal in EXIF metadata

Example:

### fastroutes
`rake routes` can take a long time to run, I'm measuring about 7 seconds, that's enough time to want to leave and slack off. Unacceptable.

fastroutes caches output of config/routes.rb for rails applications. To avoid going stale, the md5 hash of config/routes.rb is in the filename under tmp/.

This means that you only ever run `rake routes` once after each time routes.rb has changed, then each subsequent time, you pull from "tmp/cached_routes_$(md5 config/routes.rb).txt"

### fmtnum
Formats a number using commas:

```
$ fmtnum 1000000000000000000
1,000,000,000,000,000,000
```

### gi
After [analyzing my bash history](http://tobilehman.com/blog/2013/06/18/analyzing-bash-history-and-fixing-typos/) I found it would be worthwhile to write this script, so that commonly mis-typed commands like `gi ts` and `gi tb` work as intented.
